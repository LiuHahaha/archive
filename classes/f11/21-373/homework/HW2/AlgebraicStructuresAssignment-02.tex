Assignment 2 - Friday September 16, 2011. Due Wednesday September 21 
\medskip

\noindent 
{\bf Exercise 8}: If $G$ is a group (not necessarily finite), show that every subgroup $H$ of index $[G\!:\!H] = 2$ is a normal subgroup.
\par
Is it true if $H$ has index 3?
\medskip

\noindent 
{\bf Exercise 9}: If $G$ is a group and $H, K$ are two subgroups of $G$, show that $H\,K$ is a subgroup of $G$ if and only if $H\,K = K\,H$.
\medskip

\noindent 
{\bf Exercise 10}: (Putnam 1968-B2) If $A$ is a subset of a finite group $G$, and $A$ contains more than one half of the elements of $G$, show that each element of $G$ is the product of two elements of $A$.
\medskip

\noindent 
{\bf Exercise 11}: (Putnam 1969-B1) Let $n$ be a positive integer such that $n = 23\pmod{24}$. 
Show that the sum of all the divisors of $n$ is divisible by 24. 
\medskip

\noindent 
{\bf Exercise 12}: (Putnam 1972-A5) Show that if $n$ is an integer $\ge 2$, then $n$ does not divide $2^{n}-1$.
\medskip

\noindent 
{\bf Exercise 13}: (Putnam 1972-B3) Let $a$ and $b$ be two elements in a group such that $a\,b\,a = b\,a^{2}\,b$, $a^{3} = e$ and $b^{2n-1} = e$ for some positive integer $n$.
Show that $b = e$.
\medskip

\noindent
{\bf Exercise 14}: (Putnam 1976-B2) Suppose that $G$ is a group generated by two elements $a$ and $b$, and that $a^{4} = b^{7} = a\,b\,a^{-1}b = e$, with $a^{2}\ne e$ and $b\ne e$.
\par
i) How many element of $G$ are of the form $c^{2}$ with $c$ in $G$?
\par
ii) Write each such square as $a^{m}b^{n}$ for some $m,n\in\Z$.
