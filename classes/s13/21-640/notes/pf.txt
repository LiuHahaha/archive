    p. 10
        Second to last paragraph should read 'Open Mapping Theorem',
        rather than Banach-Steinhaus

Week 12
    p. 7
        F should map (x,y) rather than x + y to x + y

        Proof of norm incomplete?

Week 14
    p. 1
        Theorem 14.1
           - typo - line 1, topological has an extra 'v'

           - A (probably minor) exception to Theorem 14.1 - What if tau includes the
            singleton {0} (by translation invariance, tau would be the discrete
            topology)? I this should be possible on a TVS. Then, however,
            the singleton {{0}} would be a local base of balanced and convex, but
            not absorbing, sets.
